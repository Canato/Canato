Besides being a developer I love to listening music, play as DJ, produce music, make partys, dance, workout, play American football, have deep conversations, play RPG, read books, see series and study.

Had a Party company for 6-7 years while doing my graduation, with big events (8k people, 3 stages, etc), but now I decided to focus on code and learning UI/UX. As I already had worked on marketing in Facebook and Google Ads and with user I'm looking forward for focus in how user should be happy using softwares. While can do a good middle camp between areas.
